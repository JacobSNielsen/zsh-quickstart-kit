I've added a notifications system to the quickstart kit. It will be used when new features are added to the kit, or there are security-related changes.

Each notice should only be displayed once, but if you don't want to see future notifications, you can disable them by running

`zqs disable-notifications`

and re-enable them with

`zqs enable-notifications`
